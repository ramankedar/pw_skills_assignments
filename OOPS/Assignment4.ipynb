    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a used for creating objects (instances of the class). A class defines a set of attributes and methods that are common to all objects of that class. An object is an instance of a class. It represents a unique entity that has its own values for the attributes defined in the class, and can perform actions using the methods defined in the class. <br>\n",
    "For example, let's say we want to model a car in a Python program. We could define a Car class that has attributes such as make, model, color, and mileage, and methods such as start, stop, and drive. Here's an example of how this might look:"

    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: This refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world and restricting access to its internal state only through a set of public methods. This allows for better organization of code, as well as improved security and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: This allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. This promotes code reuse and allows for more efficient code maintenance and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: This allows objects to take on multiple forms or types. It enables the use of a single interface to represent multiple types of objects, promoting code reuse and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: This involves focusing only on the relevant information of an object, and ignoring unnecessary details. Abstraction enables more efficient design, maintenance, and modification of code."

    "Q3. Explain why the `__init__()` function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In Python, `__init__()` is a special method that is called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object and perform any other setup tasks that are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` method takes the self parameter, which refers to the object being created, and any other parameters that are needed to initialize the object's attributes. Within the method, the attributes can be initialized using the self.attribute_name = value syntax.\n",

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: In OOPs, `self` refers to the instance of a class that is currently being manipulated. It is a reference to the object itself, and is used to access the object's properties and methods within the class. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `self` is the first parameter of any instance method in a class, and is a convention followed by most Python developers. When a method is called on an object, the object itself is automatically passed as the self parameter. This allows us to access the object's properties and methods within the method."
